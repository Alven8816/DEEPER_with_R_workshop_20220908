# CAR Workshop: Deep ensemble machine learning for estimating environmental exposure and beyond 


Time: 10:00 AM – 13:00 PM, 8 September 2022.

It will be a hybrid workshop. Both [online](zoom link) and on-site are welcome. 

Location: 553 St Kilda Road, Melbourne.


## Through the workshop, we expect you can learn:

1. Understand why and how to perform exposure assessment; 

2. Understand the exposure assessment and various related methods – their strengths and limitations;

3. How to use machine learning methods;

4. how to use the "deeper" R package to perform the deep ensemble machine learning model.


## This training includes two sessions

* **Part 1: Introduction of Deep ensemble machine learning (1 hour).** 

    Presenter for part 1: Professor Yuming Guo

* **Part 2: Practice on how to perform Deep ensemble machine learning using R package “deeper” (2 hours).**

    Tutors for part 2: Drs Alven Yu and Liam Liu


## Requirements 

-	No requirement if you only attending session 1

-	For session 2 deeper tutorial: 

1. If you prefer to use your local computer, you need to install R, RStudio on your computer and make sure:
    +  using R (\>= 3.5.0)
    +  installed certain dependent R packages: [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html), [SuperLearner(\>= 2.0-28)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SuperLearner/vignettes/Guide-to-SuperLearner.html), [deeper](https://github.com/Alven8816/deeper). You can use the following syntax to install 'deeper':
    ```r
    library(devtools)
    install_github("Alven8816/deeper")
    ```
    +  installed other suggested R packages: caret, skimr, CAST, ranger, gbm, xgboost.


2. If you want to follow our tutorial with the [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Please make sure you have a Google Drive account.

3. Please install a deeper GUI software [here](https://github.com/Alven8816/deeper)
